# *LALIGAF*

In this application you can build your own team consisting of LaLiga players (with a given starting budget) and gain points for their real-life performance. The amount of points you get depends on whether or not your player appears on the pitch on a given matchday and, if he does, on his performance. You can swap players between matchdays. Also, you can compare your score with your friends'.
